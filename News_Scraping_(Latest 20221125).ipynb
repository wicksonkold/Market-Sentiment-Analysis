With close to two decades of experience in the US market, Avancer's IAM experts are adept at addressing varied identity security challenges through the strategic deployment of the latest technological solutions and products.\", '', 'Avancer provides consulting-based solutions for key identity security challenges, aligning them with business goals and regulatory compliances. Some of the core offerings of the company include - User Provisioning, Role Management, Password Management, Access Recertification, Single-Sign-On (SSO), Multifactor Authentication (MFA), Customer Identity and Access Management (CIAM), Integration, Vulnerability Scanning, Penetration Testing, Assessment Services, Implementation Services, Migration & Upgrades, and Managed Services, among others. The company has extensive experience in servicing clients from the healthcare, financial services, manufacturing, retail, and telecommunication sectors, providing customer-centric technology to prevent data breaches, minimise cyber threats and enhance productivity and compliance.', '', 'As an integrator of identity and access management technology, the company has collaborated with various well- known technology providers including SailPoint, PingIdentity, Microsoft, CyberArk, Saviynt, and others.

This is providing gaps for hackers and people with malicious intent to target vulnerable systems and networks and poorly managed access controls, causing large-scale data breaches, ransomware, and malware attacks. Enterprises, especially those with minimal or inadequate identity security systems are becoming easy targets for cybercriminals. Further, along with cybercriminal activities, insider threat (including current employees, past employees, contractors, and vendors) has also emerged as a unique challenge in India, due to inadequate attention to access controls and govern identities using manual processes.', '', '', '', \"Identity security has, therefore, become a critical feature to help organisations minimise identity-related vulnerabilities and challenges for maintaining digital security posture in the post-COVID-19 world. In fact, the cloud-based IAM market is witnessing substantial growth in this region due to the advances in the integration of various applications and services in the cloud. Further, the market value of India's identity and access management products is estimated to cross INR 12 billion by 2025, as per Statista.\", '', '\"As the scope of identity security increases in the face of growing cybersecurity threats, adoption of remote working, reliance on cloud services and devices, it has also become imperative to have an agile and updated IAM platform. Such a platform enables users to access enterprise systems in a secure manner in any given environment, including multi-cloud and hybrid, multiple devices, remote work, and IT ecosystem. Further, in today\\'s post-COVID era, companies have found that identity security is able to provide multiple layers of protection that includes reducing risk, enhancing the experience of workers, and most importantly, automating IT processes,\" said Rajesh Mittal, Chief Technology Officer, Avancer Corp.', '', 'Stressing on the value-proposition of the company, Rajesh Mittal further said, \"While most IAM solution providers focus on solution-based (such as Zero Trust) or product-based (such as SailPoint or PingIdentity) services, at Avancer, we provide consulting-based solutions that address the key identity security challenges of an organisation, along with aligning them with the business goals and regulatory compliances that the organisation needs to adhere to, within the allocated budget and deadline.\"', '', \"With an aim to partner with Indian organisations to help them in their digital transformation journey in a secure manner, Avancer is extending its services in India with a focus on maximising a company's security program, along with optimising the company's ROI in IAM technology.\", '', 'For garnering higher footprints in India, Avancer is planning to invest around USD 5 million in the next five years.

Spending more money puts inflation at risk.', '', 'Since May, the RBI has increased interest rates by 190 basis points, and it is anticipated that it would do so again in its December policy. For October, retail inflation slowed to around 7%. One of the main causes of inflation, commodity prices will decrease during a recession in advanced economies. However, the Russia-Ukraine war is far from over, and supply chains are in flux, so there is still a high level of uncertainty regarding the future of the global economy. Any deviation from the course of inflation control will be a dangerous wager.', '', 'The relative superior performance of India in comparison to its counterparts in terms of inflation and GDP would also have an impact on the choice of any tax adjustments. Despite dire predictions for the global economy, India is seen as a shining example. Kristalina Georgieva, the head of the IMF, recently praised India as a shining example of the global economy and emphasized how structural reforms have fueled India’s growth momentum.', '', 'The second half of the current fiscal will be crucial in terms of the uncertain global environment and its impact on India, according to Ritika Chhabra, an economist and quant analyst at Prabhudas Lilladher. If the government opts for a tax cut, it will affect its ability to spend on capital expenditures.', '', '“Any reduction in personal income tax rates indicated in the next budget is quite doubtful. Despite this year’s direct and indirect tax receipts being strong thus far, the second half will be crucial due to the uncertain state of the global economy and its implications on the Indian economy “said Chhabra.', '', 'The prospects for India will be improved by the situation in the rural areas. A decrease in rural demand has been caused by increasing inflation. Consumer non-durables have consistently signaled rural distress by being in the red. However, since it is anticipated to increase incomes, a healthy Rabi crop sowing bodes well for rural demand. Once the harvest is available on the market the following year, cereal inflation is likely to decline.', '', 'On the strength of a good harvest and a reduction in inflation brought on by falling commodity prices globally, FMCG companies are also optimistic about a recovery in demand in rural areas. The upcoming Budget will also mention measures to increase spending while taking into account rural distress. Social programs may be expanded. “The federal government continues to place a high focus on encouraging the early investment cycle through continuing increases in public capital expenditure. Additionally, while several metrics point to urban India’s relative prosperity, the same cannot be said about rural India.', '', 'Consequently, it may be necessary to increase expenditure on the rural economy, including the expansion of social programs. This demand that revenue momentum is maintained, “Anand Rathi Shares and Stock Brokers’ Chief Economist and Executive Director, Sujan Hajra, said. He believes that personal income taxpayers won’t see much relief from the upcoming Budget. According to him, “the buoyancy in such tax collection also gives the impression that the relatively better-off portion of the population is doing well and direct tax sops may not be needed right away.”', '', 'The FM will bear in mind how crucial it is to keep the economy moving toward fiscal reduction. On the strength of strong tax receipts, India is predicted to meet the planned fiscal deficit target of 6.4% for FY23. According to a report by BofA Securities, higher-than-anticipated nominal GDP growth will keep the fiscal gap at 6.4% of GDP. Any reduction in income taxes will make the fiscal calculations more difficult at a time when India’s sound economic fundamentals are probably acting as a magnet for international capital flows.', '', '“The government’s fiscal consolidation initiatives would gain more credibility if it could resist the temptation to announce a populist measure like tax cuts,” Chhabra continued. Cutting taxes won’t be an easy choice in the wake of global uncertainties, even though the government will want to increase consumer spending to boost demand.', '', 'India will modify its capital gains tax in its upcoming budget.', '', 'India is to make adjustments to its capital gains tax system in the next budget to achieve parity between tax rates and holding periods for investments in equity, debt, and real estate. According to an official involved in the process who spoke on the condition of anonymity, asset classes are currently not taxed equally and have different holding periods for levying capital gains tax, which needs to be aligned.', '', 'The industry has submitted several proposals to the government that would streamline the capital gains tax system, and the official predicted changes would be included in the Budget for 2023–2024 without going into further detail due to the nature of the discussions. India levies an investment gain tax based on a holding period or lock-in. Long-term investments, defined as those held for more than a year, are subject to a 10% tax on gains exceeding 100,000 rupees. Equity investments held for less than a year are regarded as short-term and are subject to a 15% tax.', '', 'While an investment in debt-oriented funds qualifies for the long-term categorization, which levies a 20% tax rate on gains, if held for at least two years, immovable property, such as land, do not. Short-term investments in real estate are taxed at the individual income tax rate since they are held for less than two years.', '', 'Industry group CII made various recommendations to finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, including the creation of jobs, the rationalization of GST, and the use of personal income tax slabs to increase consumption. To provide economic development an investment-driven boost, privatization and increased capital spending were the main topics of discussion at the pre-budget meeting, which CII attended. The external situation is probably going to stay bad for a while. Therefore, to increase domestic demand, inclusion, and growth, we must broaden the base of our domestic economy by fostering the creation of new growth sectors and jobs.', '', 'The government could consider an urban employment guarantee scheme and launch a pilot in metro cities first in this Budget to increase job creation, according to the CII. “Corporate tax rates should be kept at their current levels moving forward to give businesses tax certainty. The CII president declared that “more simplicity, rationalization, the convenience of paying taxes, and minimizing tax litigation should be a significant priority.”', '', 'The government should examine an urban employment guarantee plan and launch a trial in metro cities first in this Budget to increase job creation, according to the CII. “Corporate tax rates should be kept at their current levels moving forward to give businesses tax certainty. The CII president declared that “further simplification, rationalization, ease of paying taxes, and reducing tax litigation should be key priorities.” Almost on Monday, the industry group PHDCCI gave the finance minister its budgetary recommendations.', '', 'It proposed a five-pronged strategy to revive private investments through actions to increase consumption, boost job creation, increase factory capacity utilization, improve the standard of social infrastructure, and quicken India’s economic growth. “The presentation of the Union Budget for 2023–2024 comes at a critical time of geopolitical unpredictability, rising inflation, and sluggish global economic development.', '', 'edited and proofread by nikita sharma']\n"

That portion of the business, which operates primarily through a group karaoke app called WeSing, lost 27% of its users during the year that we owned the stock. This seems to have been caused primarily by competition from other streaming platforms, such as TikTok (Douyin in China), a risk which we underestimated.

Secondarily, we had expected growth of Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) in their music subscription business, in which TME has 70% share in China. Despite this near monopoly, competition from upstart NetEase Cloud Music has been fierce.

People looking at the curve often focus on the difference, or “spread,” between yields on 10-year bonds and two-year bonds.', '', 'Normally, long-term yields are higher than short-term yields (reflecting the higher risk in lending for a longer period). Not today.', '', 'As we speak, the 10-year yield is almost 100 basis points below the two-year. That’s extraordinary. (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) In fact, it hasn’t happened in more than three decades – and the last time it did, in the early 1990s, we had the longest recession since the Great Depression.', '', 'The inversion of 10-year and two-year yields is not an infallible signal but deep inversions – the type we’re seeing today – are highly reliable. It’s basically the market screaming that Canada is on a crash course with recession, likely in 2023.', '', 'What it means to mortgagors', '', 'By this time next year, odds are good we’ll have seen two-plus quarters of negative GDP and a significant jump in unemployment. The Bank of Canada’s answer to recessions is virtually always the same: Cut rates. The only thing we can’t be confident of this time is when that will happen.', '', 'The market is betting it’ll happen next December, but inflation has been a runaway train. If core inflation doesn’t drop fast enough, rate cuts could be a 2024 story instead.', '', 'Either way, the bond market implies that this is no time to lock into a long-term fixed mortgage. Indeed, for well-qualified borrowers who can handle rate risk, a short-term fixed is the way to play this point in the rate cycle.', '', 'Unfortunately, like Canada’s yield curve, our mortgage rate curve is also inverted. The lowest uninsured one-year fixed is now a lofty 5.89 per cent. That’s 60 bps above the lowest five-year fixed.', '', 'Interestingly, however, if you plug all that into a rate simulator and assume the bond market is correctly forecasting another 50 basis points-plus of further rate hikes and then falling rates in late 2023, today’s inflated one-year fixed still make sense. That is, it would still lead to the lowest hypothetical borrowing costs over five years, versus all other terms.', '', 'That, once again, is due to the expectation you’ll be able to renew lower by the end of next year.', '', 'Going with a one-year fixed may look good on paper but here’s the risk. If the Bank of Canada’s rate hikes don’t zap inflation quickly enough (I think they will), this particular go-short-and-reset-lower strategy will flop.', '', 'That’s why a two-year fixed is the more conservative play.

(That’s based on HSBC’s uninsured 5.54 per cent offer, which leads all national lenders.)', '', 'Rates edged lower this week', '', 'Optimism over falling inflation is pulling down bond yields. That’s led to falling fixed mortgage rates in all terms except the one-year fixed.', '', 'Amid higher demand for one-year terms and expectations for a rising overnight rate, the lowest nationally advertised one-year fixed actually climbed this week, by 20 bps. How convenient, given it’s the most logical theoretical term for risk-tolerant borrowers at this point in the rate cycle.', '', 'For default insured fixed mortgages, the picture looks better: 4.99 per cent or less for one to five year terms.
