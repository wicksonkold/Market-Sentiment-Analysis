The Safe Spaces are open to everyone, whether they are an existing HSBC UK customer or not.\", '', 'The campaign is headed by a 30 second film, which dramatises how financial abuse is used to control and trap victims and brings to life how HSBC UK can help them regain their financial independence.', '', 'In it, we see a woman in a darkened room, with her arms and legs attached to strings which limit her movement. A credit card is dangled from the ceiling on one side of the room, but as the woman walks towards it, she’s pulled back by the strings and the card is pulled away. A phone appears on the other side of the room, but again the woman is constrained by the strings and the phone is pulled out of her reach. As she becomes more desperate, she heads towards the door, but is stopped from walking through it by the strings as she fights against them. The screen fades to the message ‘When an abuser controls your finances, they control you’, and a voiceover says ‘if you need help regaining your financial independence, speak to us’, as we see the woman freed of her strings and leaving the room behind her.', '', 'The film will air across online and on-demand video, with a bespoke All4 on-demand ad directing viewers to their nearest HSBC branch through a dynamic store locator function, and HSBC UK will be one of the first brands to feature on Netflix’s new ‘Basic with Ads’ subscription plan. It will be supported by radio and out-of-home - which will feature across a range of discreet formats with high dwell time, where users are more likely to be on their own, and include a QR code so people can find out how to get help – along with impactful higher footfall outdoor locations.', '', 'To drive awareness for underrepresented audiences who statistically are less likely to report being victims of financial abuse and may be more isolated, the campaign will also utilise ads within community press publications to enable it to be seen as widely as possible.', '', \"Becky Moffat, CMO at HSBC UK, said, ‘Escaping an abusive relationship isn’t as simple as walking out of the door – something our hard-hitting ‘Financial Abuse'’ film brings to life. Victims need financial independence to help them build a new life and we’re proud to be able to offer that first step at every one of our HSBC UK branches. We hope to build awareness of the link between domestic violence and economic abuse and control, offering our services to those who need it through targeted placements to spread this message as far as possible.”\", '', 'Mike Watson, creative director at Wunderman Thompson UK, said, “Financial abuse is one of the most sinister forms of control. Without access to money, there’s nowhere to go. It’s one of the main reasons people return to an abusive partner. We wanted to highlight the importance of being financially independent while promoting the services HSBC offers that can help people regains theirs. We hope our campaign helps give as many people as possible a way out of these coercive relationships.”', '', 'Patrick Ryan, CEO at Hestia Housing and Support, comments, “This powerful campaign launches at a critical time. At Hestia we see and support survivors every day. Many are telling us that their abusers are exploiting the current cost-of-living crisis to intensify control. Although community services are more stretched than ever, we must raise awareness of the support that is available. By providing Safe Spaces for people to access across all its branches, I have no doubt that Hestia and HSBC UK will save lives. We’re delighted to partner with HSBC UK to spread this vital message and support victims.”']\n"

In fact, a superyacht as a first boat is more common in this region than in the rest of the world, where owners typically upgrade through a series of increasingly large yachts before taking the plunge and buying above 80ft or 100ft.', '', 'HSBC Global Private Banking, which has a long history of helping finance and structure superyacht purchases around Asia, revealed that earlier this year it helped a client buy a 100ft-plus yacht valued in the region of US$10 million — impressive for a first boat.', '', '“In Asia, someone’s first yacht may be a 100-footer and our client’s first was above that length. It’s a very nice vessel,” says Jyrki Rauhio, HSBC Global Private Banking’s Regional Head of Credit Advisory, Asia Pacific. “Usually, most buyers would have had several boats before buying a superyacht, but the fact he’s spending US$10 million on his first shows the difference in the market here.”', '', 'Stressing how Covid has inspired a strong feeling of carpe diem, he cites a Hong Kong-based tycoon who has been involved in a lengthier purchase of what could be termed a megayacht. Built in Italy, it should be delivered in 2023 and has a value close to US$100 million.', '', '“He wanted to realise a dream,” Rauhio says. “His yacht is of a serious size, but it’s a great example of a project that has been built during Covid for somebody who wanted to realise their dream. Once he gets it, he can enjoy using it far more widely than just cruising around Hong Kong.”', '', 'READ MORE: Sunseeker Reveals Ocean 460 Superyacht', '', 'Rollercoaster Market', '', 'Rauhio, whose job scope covers Asia Pacific, says the mindset of people in the region has been influenced by a reaction to the Covid era’s restrictions, much as it has elsewhere in the world.', '', '“Everybody’s worldview has changed in the last couple of years. People have altered the way they approach life, family, work, holidays and so on. There has been a feeling of ‘you live only once’,” he says. “As such, many yacht dealers have done very good business and it has also been evident in the supercar market”.', '', 'For all the upsides in the “trophy assets” sector, Rauhio admits that the overall superyacht financing market spanning the various countries and regions across Asia “has been a very interesting rollercoaster, with ups and downs”.', '', '“We’ve closed deals and we’re working on more, but it has been an interesting two or three years and the gyrations have been huge, as have the regional discrepancies.”', '', 'In Hong Kong, the yachting market picked up quickly in 2020 after the initial fear of Covid waned, leading to record yacht sales for many dealers and brokers. However, Rauhio says the post-Covid boom in the yachting market has slowed a little, coinciding with more restrictions at the start of the year and a more unsettled business climate.', '', '“Soon after Covid began, people started getting interested in boats and many were sold in the secondary market. This was when [interest] rates were still low. Our clients came to us for funding and there was a lot of activity; we issued plenty of term sheets and closed quite a few deals,” he says.', '', '“People getting on their boats and cruising around Sai Kung or elsewhere was the closest they had to a mini-holiday for the first couple of years of Covid.', '', '“However, that euphoria has cooled a little. Coming into 2022, we moved into higher rates and more uncertainty, with people wondering whether buying a yacht was a good idea. Quite a lot of the people looking at these large yachts had their businesses face headwinds and had better use for their cash, although we’re still working on multiple transactions in Hong Kong.”', '', 'Rauhio says his recent travels around Southeast Asia have given him cause for optimism and gives examples of how overall wealth in Asia and around the world continues to grow.', '', '“I’ve recently been in Jakarta, Singapore and Manila, and business prospects look pretty good, people are enjoying themselves, so I think the superyacht sector will continue doing reasonably well, although it’s subject to the market,” he says.', '', '“The number of people holding US$250,000 in Vietnam, the Philippines and India will more than double by 2030, according to HSBC research. It’s an example of how wealth in this region will continue to grow, despite how the markets perform and geopolitical happenings. It’s an unstoppable trend and with it comes a desire for assets like yachts and other items.”', '', 'CGI c/o Fraser.', '', 'Question Time', '', 'In Hong Kong late last year, HSBC Global Private Banking invited clients to visit and tour three motor yachts up to about 120ft in Deep Water Bay in an event organised with a local dealer. Rauhio was happy to see the reaction of clients, but believes potential owners should think long and hard before committing to such a purchase.', '', '“The clients loved it, having champagne and canapes, and spending a day on a very nice yacht. It can potentially stir an impulse purchase, but clients should ask whether it makes sense for them on more than just an emotional level.”', '', 'He also cautions potential owners who may have first enjoyed yachting in the Mediterranean or Caribbean, especially if they assume a similar infrastructure for superyachts exists in Asia.', '', '“If their first experience was on a holiday or charter in the Med or the Caribbean, they may have thought owning a yacht is a great idea,” he says. “It is a great idea in the Med, where you can easily go from port to port, but in Asia, you need to think realistically about how you can and want to use your yacht and where you want to go.”', '', 'A yacht is also very different from most other trophy assets, especially passive ones such as art or luxury watches. A superyacht is in a different cost bracket to supercars and is only partly comparable to a private jet. The rule of thumb for annual running costs of a superyacht is up to 10 per cent of the purchase price, once you include crew, insurance, berthing, fuel, maintenance and more.', '', '“A yacht is a very complex asset to own, even more complex than a plane. You must keep a plane airworthy, but it’s highly regimented and regulated, and can be overseen by a management company. In the boat industry, certainly in Asia, it’s not plug and play, and it can be a complex process to find the right people, suppliers and support,” he says.', '', '“The running costs are quite a large cash outflow, which is fine if you have enormous cashflow coming in, as many of our clients do. For most of our clients, it’s not a question of whether you’re rich enough but whether you really want to spend this kind of money on this asset. Do you want to get involved in all the costs and hassles of ownership?”', '', 'Personal Choice', '', 'However, once a buyer has committed to purchase, HSBC Global Private Banking works with clients on how best to structure any purchase and how to set up ownership, and even — if needed — to help discuss the type of yacht they wish to buy.', '', 'Choosing a yacht can involve discussions about pre-owned, new or custom build, special features and size, which can be a personal choice or based on the owner’s plans, such as whether it will be used for long journeys and ocean crossings. The choices are far more varied and complicated than when choosing a private jet, when it’s far clearer how the client is likely use it.', '', '“For a plane, a client may typically fly within Asia or to Europe or New York, and estimate that they fly 20 or so times a year, for example. Based on usage, you determine the size and narrow it down to a few options,” he says.', '', '“Planes are more limited than yachts, where we have more of an advisory relationship. A yacht purchase is more emotional and the options for design and customisation are endless.”', '', 'He also cites a client in Australia as an example of someone who knew what he was looking for and how he was going to use it. Rauhio visited the client’s house in Sydney and was amazed at the personal involvement in the design of his upcoming yacht.', '', '“He had a beautiful house and one of the rooms was full of blueprints of the yacht, which measures a couple of hundred feet. He had all these blueprints taped around the walls, so that was like his design room. He got very deeply involved in the actual customisation of his yacht.', '', '“When you get to that level of involvement, you know all the questions have been answered. He then used this yacht to travel between continents, cross oceans, going up the coast from the Panama Canal to Alaska.”', '', 'CGI c/o Fraser', '', 'Structuring an Acquisition', '', 'Once a yacht has been identified, discussions revolve around how to structure a purchase. For starters, HSBC’s yacht financing is not about enabling purchase. Clients typically can afford the outlay and the yacht sits within a large portfolio of hard and soft assets.', '', '“The important question for the client is, ‘Do you really want to tie up your capital for the full value of the yacht? Then you get into what we do, and this is where the financing angle comes in,” says Rauhio, who admits such discussions are a little more complex now than even just a year ago, when rates were lower.', '', '“If you’re a successful businessperson, tying up US$50 million in an asset that yields a negative cashflow is not necessarily a smart thing. You’d rather release some liquidity from that and invest it in something that brings you a positive cashflow to help offset the cost of ownership.', '', '“As we stress, our yacht financing is not about enabling purchase but about making your money and equity sweat harder. If you earn a 10 per cent yield on your capital in your primary activity, then even with these rates, financing makes a lot of sense while using your hard-earned cash possibly doesn’t.”', '', 'The structures of yacht financing and ownership can vary widely. Rauhio says the tycoon who ordered a yacht valued at close to US$100 million was looking how to best finance it and structure the acquisition. HSBC Global Private Banking arranged pre-delivery financing, approving a facility against the project, and has separately arranged delivery financing.', '', '“He’s a very good client of ours and has substantial assets. We enabled him to finance the entire construction period so when the project is realised, he will take delivery, but he has been mostly using our money to build it. He then effectively puts in the equity at the end,” Rauhio says.', '', '“We take a fair amount of risk, but because of our deep and long-term relationship with this HSBC Group connected client, we were happy to take that risk.”', '', 'Otherwise, financing structures can be more straightforward, with options including placing the boat in a trust, depending on the client and family estate. Rauhio says the financing for the first-time buyer of a US$10 million yacht was about 50 per cent LTV (loan to value).', '', '“Basically, we need a borrower and a guarantor. Typically, you establish an SPV (special purpose vehicle) to hold and own the boat. The SPV becomes the borrower and there’s a personal guarantee by the client,” he says.', '', '“It can make sense for a family estate to hold it in an SPV, especially if you charter the yacht. All the running costs and assets are in one place, and it can be run as a mini company, which can be used to hire the crew and make and receive all other payments.”', '', 'HSBC has also, with prior approval, put clients in touch with other clients who have been through the process, for advice and learnings.', '', '“We can connect you with others going through the same thing,” Rauhio says. “Maybe you want to have a discussion with a like-minded millionaire locally in Asia to discuss how they did this, as opposed to having a Zoom call with somebody offshore, for example. That’s an advantage.”', '', 'Ultimately, HSBC Global Private Banking has the on-ground expertise and experience across Asia to help clients make their money work for them, offsetting some of the large costs of what’s often seen as the ultimate trophy asset but also one that can be used as a working ‘home away from home’ when required.', '', '“As a wealth partner, we’re here to help enable our clients to do it. We even had one client who had both a yacht and a plane, and if you want to go down the trophy asset lane, we can even finance the art you want to put in your yacht,” Rauhio smiles.', '', '“It’s all part of your wealth and we want to accompany you on your wealth journey, whether it’s hard or soft assets, commercial or leisure. If you’re thinking about a yacht, I’d encourage you to engage with us. It’s worth a discussion.”', '', 'For more yacht reads, click here.', '', 'Disclaimer: Investments in emerging markets may be extremely volatile and subject to sudden fluctuations of varying magnitude due to a wide range of direct and indirect influences.

Barrowman appears to have been personally involved in setting up PPE Medpro’s deals with a supply chain partner, Loudwater Trade and Finance, in which PPE Medpro committed to using its “extensive network” to seek contracts with the UK government.

The £3m capital injection was later repaid into Barrowman’s trust by PPE Medpro, along with interest, the report states.', '', 'Contacted this week, PPE Medpro declined to comment about whether Barrowman had invested in the company, citing a continuing investigation. Barrowman also declined to offer further comment citing live investigations, but his lawyer said he disputes the Guardian’s “claims and accusations”.', '', 'Barrowman will now be under pressure to explain why he received at least £65m in PPE Medpro profits, and apparently passed on around half of that to his wife and her children, all via offshore payments.', '', 'Barrowman and Mone’s huge windfall from PPE Medpro’s profits appears to have landed at an auspicious time for the couple: a few weeks before their wedding in the Isle of Man and honeymoon in the Maldives.', '', 'An image of Mone posted on her Instagram account.', '', 'Their extraordinary enrichment from the profits of PPE Medpro may explain why Mone continued to lobby the government for further business for the company, months after it had been awarded £203m in PPE contracts.', '', 'Around the time Mone’s trust received tens of millions in profits originating from PPE Medpro, she appears to have lobbied another then Tory minister, James Bethell, this time promoting the company’s sale of Covid-19 tests, leaked emails suggest.', '', 'PPE Medpro ultimately failed to persuade the government to buy its antigen tests, despite Mone’s continued efforts to pull strings with her political contacts.', '', 'In February 2021, back from her honeymoon, Mone appears to have been lobbying again, according to an email sent by Jacqui Rock, the chief commercial officer for NHS test and trace.', '', 'The senior civil servant told colleagues that Mone was angry at the treatment of PPE Medpro, whose products were being subjected to tests.

The supply of products of this nature has led to an increase in making false or misleading environmental claims in advertisements also known as \"greenwashing\". A recent ruling by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK illustrates the problems that can occur.', '', 'The Facts', '', 'Two posters for HSBC UK Bank plc (HSBC), were displayed at bus stops in Bristol and London in October 2021.The first poster featured an aerial image of waves crashing on a shore with text that stated \"Climate change doesn\\'t do borders. Neither do rising sea levels. That\\'s why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero\". The second poster featured an image of tree growth rings with text that stated \"Climate changes doesn\\'t do borders. So in the UK , we\\'re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime\".', '', \"The ASA received numerous complaints. The advertisements were challenged on the basis that they were misleading because they omitted significant information about HSBC's contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.\", '', \"HSBC said it had been making the claim in the first poster since 2020 directed at providing financing and investment globally to help some of its clients' transition to net zero by 2030. HSBC said that the financing of greenhouse gas-emitting industries was required during the transition to net zero, and so their continued financing of those industries was not in conflict with the aims of a transition to net zero.\", '', 'The claim in the second poster related to a four-year partnership HSBC had entered into with the National Trust , worth Ł4 million, to create 2,000 hectares of carbon-rich woodland. Under that partnership HSBC endeavoured to plant two million trees by 2025, which according to the Woodland Carbon Code, and based on the average 100-year lifespan of a tree, would lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon.', '', 'HSBC said it believed the claims made highlighted two tangible and specific short-to-medium term initiatives, capable of quantifiable measurement, and would not be seen as commenting, in a broader sense, on their green credentials or environmental contribution.', '', 'The Code that ASA applies requires that the basis of environmental claims must be clear and that unqualified claims can mislead if they omit significant information.', '', 'The ASA determined that consumers would understand the claims \" HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero\" and \"we\\'re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon in their lifetime\" to mean that HSBC was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, consumers would understand that HSBC was committed to ensuring its business and lending model would help support businesses\\' transition to models that supported net zero targets. Additionally, they would understand that HSBC was undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting trees which would contribute towards the sequestration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Using imagery from the natural world, and in particular the image of waves crashing on a beach, contributed to that impression.', '', \"Despite the initiatives highlighted in the posters HSBC was continuing to significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. The ASA did not consider consumers would know that was the case, and it was material information that was likely to affect consumers' understanding of the ads' overall message, and so should have been clarified in the ads. The ASA concluded that the posters omitted material information and were misleading.\", '', 'The claims in the posters were ordered not to appear again in the form complained of.

Such claims include any messages, pictures, or verbal communications, including online and in-store advertisements, social media messages and promotional emails. To determine whether a claim is false or misleading, the courts consider the \"general impression\" conveyed, as well as the literal meaning. The Competition Act also prohibits performance claims that are not based on adequate and proper testing. This includes any form of statement, warranty or guarantee of a product\\'s performance, efficacy or length of life.', '', 'In the past the Bureau has attacked representations which are literally or technically true but fail to disclose essential information, so steps would likely be taken concerning representations similar to those made in the UK by HSBC .', '', 'The Commissioner of Competition has the option under the Act to enforce the misleading advertising provisions as civil matters reviewable by the Competition Tribunal or the civil courts, or as offences prosecuted in the criminal justice system. The choice to proceed with either regime is within the discretion of the Commissioner.

How can the industry scale up this transition at pace, decarbonise production, invest in clean energy and still supply energy to meet growing demand?', '', '“There was a clear urgency in the room, and indeed across the ADIPEC exhibition halls, that finding balance between energy security and energy transition was the top priority facing every part of the industry value chain, from national resource owners and their operating partners to midstream and downstream supply chains, with decarbonisation at the top of everyone’s list.” said Sean Evers, Managing Partner at Gulf Intelligence, and the moderator of the session.', '', 'Ensuring energy security means not only providing consistent access to energy, but also securing supplies at an affordable price. Producers across the globe are investing in technologies and prioritising energy efficiency to manage the increase in demand. However, this rapid increase in demand could lead to a rise in carbon and other emissions. Policy changes and government decarbonisation targets are placing pressure on producers to diversify their energy mix and accelerate the energy transition as well as drive investments in cleaner, modern energy.', '', 'Damon Hill, Wood’s President of Growth and Development for projects, and host of the session said, “It was evident from the discussion that fossil fuels will continue to play a major role in safeguarding a steady and reliable energy supply. However, to ensure we don’t undermine the efforts already in place to tackle climate change, the industry needs to continue addressing this challenge at pace and set their own strategies to reduce their carbon emissions throughout the value chain.”', '', 'Leaders around the table expanded on the topic regarding stronger climate targets and investment incentives, which the global environmental agenda has accelerated, and how this has created more momentum around hydrogen and CCUS in particular.', '', 'Damon added: “Hydrogen is an attractive energy source due to its cleaner burn and versatility and while the pipeline for these projects continues to grow, the deployment is trailing and production at scale is a new challenge facing the industry.', '', '“The Middle East is positioning to become one of the world’s major hydrogen hubs, specifically for the manufacturing of green hydrogen. Not only does the region have access to plenty of low-cost renewable sources of energy, but it has the capital required to integrate renewables into new and existing infrastructure.”', '', 'The roundtable concluded with an agreement that energy security and energy transition are not separate challenges. Delivering energy diversity through transition, digital integration as well as reducing emissions from existing energy sources are all key to ensuring the security and stability of energy supplies, now and in the future. It is crucial that the industry collaborates, invests and continues to commit to addressing these challenges to ensure a sustainable world for generations to come.', '', 'The output of the roundtable discussion is being collated into a whitepaper which will be released early next year.', '', 'Want to hear more insights from Wood on this topic?

The kingdom is in the \"final\" stage of discussions to offer Turkey assistance, a Saudi Ministry of Finance spokesperson said, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. Turkey\\'s Ministry of Treasury and Finance also confirmed that the two countries are about to finalize the deposit deal. Almost certain to be inked soon, the agreement crowns a recent rapprochement that ended years of hostility between the Turkish and Saudi governments. It will also be the a major win for Erdogan since he turned to Gulf Arab states for financial help earlier this year. His finance chief Nureddin Nebati has led the efforts to secure assistance from the kingdom as well as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Erdogan told journalists earlier that Turkey\\'s official reserves would likely rise to $130 billion soon, up from the 2022 peak of $117.5 billion seen during the week of Nov. 11. —Matthew Martin, Beril Akman and Firat Kozok, Bloomberg News']\n"

One possible outcome is that more retirement plans will add ESG products, he said.', '', 'Dial expects the DOL rule to have more staying power than those proposed in earlier years. “This rule is very carefully drafted to be in the middle…It gives some consideration to both sides of this debate,” he said. “I think [the DOL did] a pretty good job of trying to find that middle road and maybe something that’s a little more durable than what we’ve had in the prior years.”', '', 'Lia Mitchell, senior policy analyst at Morningstar, agreed. “I do think that this rule is going back to the basics and highlighting the elements of future standards that plan sponsors can rely on...That might be one reason to think it will persist a little bit longer [than previous rules],” she said.', '', '', '', 'The DOL rule comes at a time when the debate over ESG investments continues to heat up.

As such, they are urging central banks to ensure that efforts to curb inflation in the shorter-term accelerate the net-zero transition rather than undermining it.', '', 'The analysis rates each of the G20 central banks on a range of green economy metrics including research and advocacy, monetary policy and financial regulation. Banks are then given an overall score out of a potential 130 points, plus a grade from A+ to F.', '', 'At the bottom of the table, with zero points and an F grade, is Saudi Arabia. Argentina also takes an F grade, as it has no climate-related monetary policy or financial policy measures in place.', '', 'Barely faring better, with D- grades overall, are South Africa, Turkey, the US, Australia, Russia and South Korea.', '', 'The US’s Federal Reserve scores ten out of ten for its research and advocacy efforts but zero out of 50 for monetary policy interventions. It also scores low on financial policy interventions, but Positive Money notes that this score may increase next year if, as planned, climate risk scenario analyses are piloted. This activity would require the bank to assess risk in a range of warming scenarios. The US federal government is also eyeing mandatory climate risk disclosures for some businesses, following in the UK’s footsteps.', '', 'All in all, Positive Money believes that the US is “trailing behind” other economies with high levels of historic emissions and high annual emissions at present. The world’s biggest annual emitter at present, China, takes joint sixth place with Brazil and has been awarded a C grade overall.', '', 'The UK is sitting in fifth place. The Bank of England scores top marks for research and advocacy, but just ten out of 50 possible points for monetary policy. Most of the interventions it has made here so far are classed as ‘low-impact’, with the Bank undertaking no ‘high-impact’ actions.', '', '27 out of 50 possible points are awarded for the BoE’s financial policy intervention despite, again, no ‘high-impact’ actions being taken. The report states: “Whilst the Bank of England has not gone so far as to align its asset purchase facilities with the Paris Agreement, it has created a framework for greening the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme, which excludes issuers engaged in any coal mining activities (Bank of England, 2021), and has begun making sales from the Corporate Bond Purchase Scheme with climate change considerations as a secondary aim.”', '', 'Positive Money does note that the UK is leading the way on climate-related financial disclosures and in facilitating collaboration with other central banks, other finance sector players, policymakers and the general public on the low-carbon transition. However, the conclusion is that the ambition of the UK becoming the world’s first net-zero financial centre, stated by then-Chancellor Rishi Sunak at COP26 in November 2021, is not yet within reach.', '', 'Top of the table is France, the only nation to receive a B-. Rounding out the top five are Italy, Germany and the EU (with the European Investment Bank).', '', 'France’s central bank scores so highly as it has aligned all non-monetary portfolios with a 1.5C temperature pathway and implemented the strongest fossil fuel exclusions of any G20 central bank. This includes a complete exit from coal by 2024. It also oversees mandatory sustainability-related disclosures and climate and environmental risk disclosures across the financial sector.', '', 'Positive Money has emphasised that France is currently the exception, not the rule – and that even France could be going further and faster to finance the low-carbon transition and also redirect financial flows which harm nature.', '', 'Lead report author Nikki Eames said: “Volatile fossil fuel prices and extreme weather events this year should be enough to convince central banks and regulators that supporting the net zero transition is a central pillar of their core mandates for price and financial stability. We need policymakers to act decisively to help shift financial flows to a credible pathway to net zero, and stop allowing financial institutions to lock in long-term environmental risks which jeopardise economic stability.”', '', '‘Don’t bank on it’', '', 'In related news, the Make My Money Matter campaign has launched a new workstream whereby banking customers at some of the UK’s biggest banks can call on these businesses to implement stronger fossil fuel exclusion and divestment policies.', '', 'The new ‘don’t bank on it’ campaign builds on work already underway to pressure pension schemes to improve the environmental impact of their financial activities.', '', 'Under the new campaign, HSBC, Barclays, Santander, NatWest Group and Lloyds Bank are being called upon to end the financing of any oil, gas and coal expansion, in line with the International Energy Agency’s (IEA) 2050 net-zero scenario. This scenario, published in 2021 in the lead-up to COP26, recommended an end to all additional fossil fuel expansion beyond what had already been confirmed by the end of 2021.', '', 'Make My Money Matter is citing previous research from ShareAction, which claims that the five banks targeted collectively funnelled $367.6bn into fossil fuel activities since the end of 2015, of which $141bn went to companies with significant oil and gas expansion plans. HSBC was the worst offender in both respects. A poll of 2,000 UK-based adults using these five banks found that 77% were not aware that their bank supported fossil fuel expansion.', '', 'ShareAction project manager Kelly Shields said: “ShareAction research found that UK banks are providing billions to fifty of the top oil and gas expanders in the world. Worryingly, half of new projects are unconventional, meaning companies are expanding into the riskiest types of fossil fuels to extract, such as those found in the Arctic. We urge banks in the UK to listen to the justified concerns of customers and publish plans by the end of 2023 to restrict financing for new oil and gas to prevent the worst impacts of the climate crisis.”', '', 'The news comes just weeks after the UK’s Advertising Standards Authority banned two adverts placed by HSBC on greenwashing grounds. The regulator ruled that the ads could mislead customers into thinking that its financing activities have a net-positive impact on the environment and that HSBC was knowingly concealing important details about its energy financing.']\n"

            "[\"In the latest episode of the 'Ganado Meets Finance' podcast, Catherine Formosa Senior Associate at Ganado Advocates, speaks with Joyce Grech, Head of Commercial Banking and member of the Executive Committee of HSBC Malta on a range of topics including risks and challenges faced by banks, the current environment for Maltese corporates, sustainability and ESG as well as female participation in senior positions.\", '', 'self', '', 'During the initial part of the podcast, Joyce Grech takes the listeners through the various experiences which made up her career at HSBC Malta over the years, culminating in two important roles, that of Chief Risk Officer and her current role as Head of Commercial Banking. Despite working within the same organization, Joyce Grech believes she had the opportunity to grow and experience banking from different perspectives.', '', 'The discussion delved into the role of risk managers within banks and other financial institutions which has changed dramatically in line with the broadening of the risk taxonomy and risk becoming an enterprise-wide concept. Joyce Grech described how risks within banks evolved from typically being labelled only as \"credit risk\" or \"market risk\". Today\\'s risk managers need to adapt to and appreciate the breadth of the risks of the institution, look beyond the present and be also subject matter specialists. The focus of the risk unit within the organization can literally change from one day to the next.', '', \"Joyce Grech emphasized how identifying and understanding one's risks provides opportunities to manage and improve one's chances of success. The everchanging regulatory environment, people risk resources, cyber security risk and climate change risk are amongst the most notable risks faced by banks. Although it may not be immediately evident, climate change risk impacts banks in other areas such as credit risk, reputation risk and business continuity. Nonetheless, in every risk there are also opportunities. Joyce Grech also spoke about being employed in a customer-oriented role versus being involved within the risk function which at face value may appear to be two roles on different ends of the spectrum. Within the risk sector, the challenge is keeping the customer in mind when setting the risk appetite and in taking decisions as to how to mitigate against the relative risks.\", '', 'Joyce Grech described what she considers the primary challenges faced by Maltese businesses within the current complex environment, particularly those caused by the lingering effects of the pandemic and the war in Ukraine. She noted how disruptions in supply chains, increases in prices and reduction in capacities induced businesses to revisit their business models to address, amongst others, impact on cash flows, working capital requirements and trade cycles. Having an element of contingency inbuilt into processes and being agile are key. Additionally, against a background of regulatory demands which banks may have to pass on to their customers, the role of a bank is to, as far as possible facilitate processes for their customers particularly, through technology. One area which adds further pressure on both banks and customers is in fact regulatory reporting relating to ESG. Banks have duties to report exposures and they need to obtain certain information from their customers.', '', \"Joyce Grech discussed the issue of sustainability and recognizes that the attitudes and the level of preparedness towards this challenge differ from one business to another, something which is also evident worldwide. It is critical for businesses to look beyond short to medium term gains – sustainability will catch up with everyone and will result in pressures from consumers, suppliers, regulators and governments. Banks have a role to play not only by assisting customers in transitioning to green sources of energy or in customers' sustainability initiatives through products, solutions, knowledge and expertise sharing but also in raising awareness to the risks if action in this field continues being postponed. Ultimately, the future growth of banks themselves will also be in part impacted by their ability to support and encourage sustainability related business strategies.\", '', 'The final part of the podcast touched upon female participation, in the boardroom or at senior management levels, an area about which Joyce Grech feels strongly. Joyce Grech gave her views about the level of local participation by women in senior roles and considers that banks should be at the forefront of this area, not only because regulators are focusing on diversity in its various facets but also because of the real benefits which diversity can bring to an organisation.', '', 'The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter. Specialist advice should be sought about your specific circumstances.']\n"
