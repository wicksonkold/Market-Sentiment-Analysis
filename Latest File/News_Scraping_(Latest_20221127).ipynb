            "['Karel Doshi - Country Head of Commercial Banking, HSBC Malaysia', '', 'Mid-Market Enterprises (MMEs), Mid-Tier Companies or Medium-Sized Companies, call them what you would like, but these companies, wedged between smaller companies who receive government support and larger companies who have access to capital markets and other investors, are navigating a fine-balancing act between growing their business operations and managing uncertainties, be it geopolitical, financial or operational risks.', '', 'Nevertheless, this has not dampened their entrepreneurial spirit, according to a recent study by HSBC titled the Business Balancing Act (BBA)*. Interestingly, the BBA survey showed that nine out of 10 (93%) MMEs in Malaysia are expecting to grow their sales in 2023, with the introduction of new products and services and technology-driven efficiencies cited as the main drivers for growth.', '', 'Is the optimism amongst Malaysian MMEs the outlier in this scenario? Not quite, as the findings for Malaysia aligns with global sentiment, where 93% of MMEs across 14 global markets (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Mexico, Singapore, UAE, UK and USA) are looking at sales growth in 2023. However, in terms of the magnitude of sales growth expected next year, there are instances where the optimism of Malaysian MMEs exceeded that of their global peers (see chart).', '', 'Striking a balance', '', 'Growth targets aside, the study highlights the balancing act that these MMEs need to manage, in terms of seizing opportunities and managing a combination of challenges in the year ahead. For example, over three quarters (78%) of Malaysian MMEs plan to enter at least one new foreign market next year, but at the same time 69% expect international trade to be more difficult due to increasing tariffs and an uncertain global political environment. Nevertheless, an interesting observation here is the drive to expand internationally by Malaysian MMEs exceeds that of their global counterparts, as the global average for companies looking to enter a foreign market next year was only at 64%.', '', 'MMEs also need to strike a balance in their digitalisation journey. Almost half (45%) of the Malaysian MMEs surveyed said they will expand to new digital platforms and channels next year-but concerns remain on a decrease in demand and consumer spending, that is crucial in justifying their shift to digital platforms.', '', 'Their concern on a decrease in demand and consumer spending ties in with another aspect of the study, which asked MMEs what were the biggest impediments or threats to their business growth or recovery next year. Malaysian MMES cited inflation and the higher cost of living as well as the increase in interest rates as the biggest threats, and these were also cited as the top threats faced by MMEs globally.', '', 'It is however refreshing to see that despite these hurdles, Malaysian MMEs have not overlooked the importance of sustainable business practices, with over three-fifths (65%) saying that they will focus on making their supply chain more sustainable next year--higher than the Asia Pacific average of 56%. However, it will once again be a balancing act for these businesses, as they face a hurdle in the form of a lack of quality suppliers and goods to enable them to source sustainably.', '', 'A display of resilience', '', 'While the balancing act that the MMEs are maintaining are a focal point of the BBA study, an underlying theme that it showcases is the resilience of these MMEs, which have survived the onslaught of the Covid-19 pandemic over the past two years, and are now regaining some ground.', '', 'They are hungry for new opportunities, and the proof is in the pudding as the BBA results show that more than two thirds (67%) of MMEs are looking for external investments to grow their businesses. Almost a third (29%) of these MMEs are planning to make an acquisition of their own to drive growth, and only a quarter (25%) expressed interest in divesting their business interests.', '', 'Though they are energised to grow their businesses, MMEs are doing so with caution and are keeping their balance sheets lean, as building up adequate cash flow and effective capital management was the top investment priority selected by a majority (72%) of Malaysian MMEs. They are also prioritising investments for marketing products and services (68%), as well investments that enhance customer experience (66%).', '', 'A temperature check for all stakeholders', '', 'Studies like the BBA are important in ensuring that MMES -- not just in Malaysia but across the globe -- remain on a growth trajectory, as they provide a temperature check for all stakeholders of MMEs, be it their customers, suppliers, employees, governments and lenders, like HSBC, through data driven analytics. According to the Malaysian Consortium of Mid-Tier Companies, there are approximately 15,000 Mid-Tier Companies in Malaysia (defined as companies with annual revenues of between RM50 million and RM500 million in the manufacturing sector and between RM20 million and RM500 million in the services sector). While this figure may seem small at only 1.7% of all registered companies in Malaysia, they contribute a staggering 40% of national gross domestic product and employ 16% of the nation\\'s workforce-this is indeed no small feat. MMEs truly are the \"engine room\" of growth for the Malaysian economy! Based on the results of the BBA survey and as a trusted advisor to our MME clients, HSBC is glad to see that the sentiment amongst Malaysian MMES is positive despite the expected headwinds next year. We hope that this positivity translates to business growth for these MMEs and further to that, we hope to help MMES realise the enormous value that they add to the country via gross domestic product, employment opportunities and to the businesses that supply them and buy from them.', '', 'Given their significant contribution to the economy, it is also imperative that there is a conducive ecosystem for MMEs to thrive, both on the domestic and international front and this is a work in progress that involves a collective effort from all stakeholders. At HSBC, we continue to support MMEs to realise their potential by scaling up and connecting them to opportunities as they expand into ASEAN, Europe, the US and beyond. For MMEs, it will continue to be a fine balancing act as they navigate the opportunities and challenges for their businesses, but we believe their resilience is key to managing this.', '', 'The Business Balancing Act survey was conducted by industry research firm Toluna between 28 September 2022 and 24 October 2022. Toluna polled chief executive officers and chief financial officers of more than 2,100 rising and established MMEs across 14 markets, with an annual turnover of between US$10 million (RM47.5 million) to US$500 million (RM2.37 billion). In Malaysia, 171 MMEs were surveyed, and they were primarily from the manufacturing, retail, digital and financial services sectors.', '', 'To reach out to HSBC on how we can support your business, contact us here.']\n"

A regional hub in South Africa was reportedly officially recognised by the Black Axe leadership in 2013, according to US legal documents viewed by the Guardian.', '', 'The trail leading to the arrests last month began in Ireland, when local police officers recovered phones and other devices belonging to fraudsters linked to Black Axe.

Not really. They run these things really effectively and there are work arounds. You get a lot of publicity for law enforcement but really it’s little more than a speed bump for the criminals,” the official said.', '', 'Corcoran said arrests had a significant disruptive effect. Recently introduced improvements to coordination and communication between the banking sector and local police forces also allowed much more rapid tracking, seizure and restitution of stolen funds.', '', 'More than $120m has been seized this year, denying fraudsters such as Black Axe capital that could be reinvested in other forms of crime, such as forcing young west African women into sex work in Europe, purchasing weapons or the growing international traffic in methamphetamines.', '', 'The return of air travel after the pandemic has allowed fraudsters to move again between key hubs of activities, former investigators say.

            "['By Nadia Lopez, CalMatters', '', 'The California Air Resources Board unveiled a new version of its highly anticipated strategy for battling climate change on Nov. 16, setting more ambitious targets for cutting greenhouse gases and scaling up controversial projects that capture carbon.', '', 'If adopted by the air board at its Dec. 15 meeting, the plan would radically reshape California’s economy, alter how Californians’ vehicles, buildings and appliances are powered, and ultimately serve as a blueprint for other states and countries to follow.', '', '“Failure is not an option,” said air board Chair Liane Randolph. “There is too much at stake and we need to move as fast and as far as we can to lessen the worst impacts of climate change and leave future generations a livable and healthy California.”', '', 'The five-year climate change strategy, called a scoping plan, outlines in its 297 pages how California could end its reliance on oil and also clean up the nation’s worst air pollution.', '', 'The staff’s final draft plan adds bolder commitments, reducing oil use by 94% from 2022 levels by 2045 — up from a goal of 91% in the September version of the plan.', '', 'The plan also sets a more aggressive goal of cutting carbon emissions 48% below 1990 levels by 2030 — up from the 40% by 2030 required under state law. Net-zero emissions would be achieved in 2045. (Net-zero or carbon neutrality means striking a balance between the carbon dioxide added to the air and the carbon that’s removed.)', '', 'California has a long way to go to meet the new 48% goal in just eight years. By 2020 it had cut emissions only about 14% below 1990 levels, according to air board officials.', '', 'Danny Cullenward, a climate economist who serves on a committee advising the state about its system for trading greenhouse gas credits, said California isn’t on track to meet its existing 2030 reduction target, much less the new, more stringent goal.', '', '“I don’t want to say California isn’t doing anything on climate. We’ve done a lot of things,” said Cullenward, who serves on the Independent Emissions Market Advisory Committee. “But this is such a superficial exercise and it’s filled with so many faults and errors.”', '', 'Air board officials, however, said they are confident that the state can achieve the new target, largely with mandates and policies enacted this year. State officials phased out sales of new gas-powered cars by 2035, set a more stringent low-carbon fuel standard and streamlined siting and permitting of renewable energy projects.', '', '“This plan is a comprehensive roadmap to achieve a pollution-free future,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement. “It’s the most ambitious set of climate goals of any jurisdiction in the world, and, if adopted, it’ll spur an economic transformation akin to the industrial revolution.”', '', 'But Cullenward criticized the staff’s modeling, which is used to predict how each sector of the economy will reduce emissions. He said the plan lacks a thorough analysis of the feasibility of its projections and makes major assumptions.', '', 'One example, he said, is that the plan relies on other agencies, such as the California Energy Commission, setting new policies, but it doesn’t address the timing and roadblocks they may face or other details.', '', '“It’s a pretty aspirational document but it’s filled with bureaucratic doublespeak,” he said. “It’s really frustrating because there’s so much work to be done.”', '', 'Some policy experts say setting ambitious goals is a crucial step toward cleaning up air pollution and combating climate change.', '', '“The scoping plan can at least help us direct our attention even if it doesn’t give us as much detail as we want,” said Dave Weiskopf, senior policy advisor with NextGen Policy, a progressive advocacy group. “On the one hand, that is really frustrating. On the other hand, it tells us that if we put in the effort to say what we think a good plan should look like, we at least have a shot of getting the state to take meaningful action.”', '', 'The new plan relies more than the original versions on two controversial, advanced technologies for eliminating planet-warming carbon dioxide. Combined, 15% — increased from 5% — of all of the state’s targeted greenhouse gas cuts will come from carbon removal and carbon capture and storage.', '', 'One strategy removes carbon from the atmosphere, such as replanting trees or storing it in soils. Another, called carbon capture and storage, collects carbon spewed from industry smokestacks and injects it into the ground.', '', 'California currently has no carbon removal or capture and storage projects, and air board officials say they wouldn’t be deployed until 2028. The state’s scenario predicts that carbon-capture technology will be installed on most of California’s 17 oil refineries by 2030 and on all cement, clay, glass, and stone facilities by 2045.', '', 'Environmental groups oppose both technologies, saying they extend the lives of fossil fuels, while oil companies say they are necessary to achieve the state’s long-term climate goals. The debate pits those who want to mandate an end to fossil fuels against those who want an approach that relies somewhat on technology to clean up carbon.', '', 'Globally, 27 carbon capture and storage projects are operating so far.', '', 'Oil industry officials declined to comment on the plan Wednesday.', '', 'Achieving the plan’s targets would cost $18 billion in 2035 and $27 billion in 2045, according to air board estimates. The move to decarbonize and transition away from fossil fuels will also drastically increase electricity use, which is expected to soar by as much as 68% in 2045.', '', 'At Newsom’s direction, the air board in September already strengthened its draft plan, originally released last May, to include new goals for offshore wind, cleaner aviation fuels and reducing vehicle miles traveled.', '', 'Other changes include constructing 3 million climate-friendly homes by 2030 and 7 million by 2035, installing at least 6 million heat pumps by 2030, and eliminating the option of building new natural gas plants or using fossil fuels in the electricity sector to maintain grid reliability.', '', 'Eliminating 100 million tons of carbon', '', 'Under a new law that Newsom prioritized in his climate package at the end of this year’s legislative session, the air board was directed to create a new program that puts guardrails on carbon capture, use and storage projects while streamlining the permitting process.', '', 'These technologies aim to remove or capture and store at least 20 million metric tons of carbon by 2030 and 100 million metric tons by 2045, according to the plan.', '', 'Once captured from smokestacks, the carbon could be transported to sites in the Central Valley. Air board staff say the valley is an ideal location for injecting carbon dioxide deep into rock formations because it has the capacity to store at least 17 billion tons.', '', 'Though controversial, air board staff say the technologies are a “necessary tool” to reduce emissions from industrial sectors, such as the cement industry, where no other alternatives may exist.', '', '“We’ve squeezed out all of the emissions that we can under the inventory for manufacturing for transportation and for industry, but we know residual emissions will remain,” said Rajinder Sahota, the board’s deputy executive officer for climate change and research. “We’re going to need all the tools in all of these categories.”', '', 'But at an Oct. 28 workshop, members of the state’s Environmental Justice Advisory Committee raised several concerns about engineered carbon removal, saying it is an unproven strategy that could continue to plague local communities with air pollution. They also say it would delay closure of oil facilities and act as a substitute for direct emissions reductions.', '', '“The Air Resources Board’s latest climate plan once again pins California’s future on a dangerous carbon capture pipe dream,” said Jason Pfeifle, a senior climate campaigner at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Caving to polluters who want to keep burning fossil fuels and dirty biomass energy is a one-way ticket to climate destruction. California needs a plan that rejects industry scams, preserves our ecosystems, and rapidly phases out fossil fuels.”', '', 'Air board staff acknowledged these concerns, but Randolph, the board’s chair, said many of the greenhouse gas targets could not be achieved without them. She said the board has prioritized creating a metric to measure how residents could be affected by these projects and also consider the needs of people who are most affected by air pollution.', '', 'Randolph said the plan’s heavy emphasis on cutting emissions from transportation will also significantly improve air quality in vulnerable communities. Cutting vehicle miles traveled and improving access to mass transit, designing more pedestrian-friendly neighborhoods and increasing access to electric bikes and vehicles all play a role.', '', 'The board expects the state’s landmark cap and trade program — which allows big polluters to buy credits to offset their greenhouse gas emissions — to play a much smaller role over time.', '', 'In the 2017 version of their scoping plan, air board officials estimated about 38% of emissions reductions would come from cap and trade. Instead, it now would help “fill the gap” to meet the accelerated 2030 emissions target.', '', 'Cap and trade has been heavily criticized by legislators and experts in recent years. One criticism is that there are at least 310 million unused credits currently in the system, which is a problem because companies hoard credits that allow them to keep polluting past state limits in later years. Air board officials say they hope to reform the program and address the oversupply of credits at the end of next year.']\n"

Through panel discussions, break-out sessions, the Asia Liberty Awards Dinner, and other events, attendees heard from leaders from across the continent about the challenges and opportunities ahead for liberal democracy. The second part of the interview follows below.)', '', 'Romeo Bernardo (RB): Rule of law is almost always cited as a lynchpin of economic freedom. For example, the index of the Heritage Foundation lists it as No. 1, followed by government size, regulatory efficiency and market openness.', '', 'The UN Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, defines such to include right to life and liberty, freedom from slavery and torture, freedom of opinion and expression, the right to work and education, and many more, without discrimination.', '', 'Your thoughts please on such a broad definition of human rights vs. the narrower one espoused in writings of some authors — and practiced in some authoritarian regimes, especially ones which have been quite successful in bringing millions of their people out of poverty, trading off limitations on political liberties — e.g. China, Vietnam. Arguably even Singapore.', '', 'RF: Rule of Law and inclusion/inequality: Acemoglu and Robinson’s monumental opus (Why Nations Fail) argues that economic liberalization in the form of thin definition of rule of law (protection of property rights and enforcement of contracts) is the lynchpin of long-term sustained growth. Thus, economic liberalization is conducive to improved inclusion (as poverty reduction shown in the People’s Republic of China [PRC]) as growth reduces poverty (Burnside and Dollar, 2000). However, the reduction in poverty incidence does not preclude the violation of the thick definition of rule of law as including respect for basic human rights (the treatment of Uighurs in PRC comes to mind).', '', 'Barro and Salai-Martin (2004, Economic Growth) were the first to point out that whereas economic liberalization significantly associates with economic growth, political liberalization has at best a little and negative association. This suggested a tradeoff and a spirited backlash. In the new world of the 21st century, well-being has many more dimensions than monetary income: environmental sustainability, shared well-being and resilience, etc., all of which can be attenuated on the way to higher per capita.', '', 'The tension spikes when the tradeoff is couched in terms of basic human rights: Did the so-called social contract to attenuate political space in exchange for economic space pay off? Depends upon the criteria of validity. If economic space means economic convergence with the high-income economies and lower poverty incidence, East Asia and PRC are evidence of its payoff.', '', 'Was it worth the lives lost or crippled? Was the Tiananmen Square Massacre in China a fair price to pay for 600 million graduating out of poverty? This is a question of the Sphinx!', '', 'There is, however, a strong evidence-based consensus that the race to the top of the per capita income ladder has scarred the environment, sometimes irretrievably; that climate change has a human agency footprint. Incidentally, the scars are worse for the previous socialist bloc than for market economies. Social unrest can follow norm violations in these other dimensions despite or because of rising income which also changes public values and perception. Finally, the carbon footprint of energy-impoverished Filipinos is so small you would need a microscope to see it.', '', 'RB: In recent years, there seems to be a drift away from liberal regimes that espouse market-based solutions (economic freedoms) towards authoritarian regimes from both the right and the left, everywhere globally. To what extent is this being driven by income inequalities and the failure of governments to address poverty and create jobs with globalization and tech change? Notable examples in developing countries are: to the right Brazil, and to the left, Colombia, Chile, Bolivia. (In the west, the USA is poster boy No. 1, and from the news earlier this week — Italy seems to have turned neo-Fascist!). Is Philippines at any risk at risk of being next? What conditions promote these?', '', 'RF: There is a great deal of debate and interest on how Francis Fukuyama (End of History) — that liberal democracy is the future of humanity — got it wrong. Is income inequality the culprit: possibly, but more salient in the literature is the loss of accustomed and expected entitlements (falling wages, potential loss of jobs from new entrants, threats to accustomed cultural matrix and social contracts from growing diversity, etc.), which can happen with or without growth in inequality. James Scott (Moral Economy of the Peasants, 1976) noted that peasants in East Asia tended to resort to violence when their accustomed standards (food intake, say) are attenuated, especially after adverse climate and harvests and the shares of the landowners do not adjust to accommodate as dictated by the moral economy. So, both inequality cum rigidity and broken expectations are indicted.', '', 'RB: I like much of what you have written in the past on the role of civil society and organizations like FEF. What can we in FEF (and similar like-minded institutions) do to help improve social welfare and preserve economic freedoms? How do we help ensure that we don’t suffer the reversals and drift to illiberal regimes, both left and right, as had happened in other developing countries?', '', 'RF: On the role of Civil Society and incremental market liberalization reforms: Most reform battles in the Philippines involve market liberalization. The reflex response of Philippine political actors to economic difficulties is to find scapegoats among market actors such as the profiteers, oligarchs, foreign investors and speculators. The normal state response is to ban or restrain market exchanges and let government take over: thus the old NFA (National Food Authority, a state monopoly in imports of rice), the OPSF (the Oil Price Stabilization Fund, a state monopoly in imports of petroleum), ban on land ownership over five hectares (CARP, the Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program), ban on mining and forestry activities; the Agri-Agra law (restraint on bank allocation), blam[ing] oligarchs for nature-triggered water shortages, etc. The Philippine economic saga from the 1990s is one of slow and spasmodic extrication from the straitjacket the state has imposed on the market.', '', 'On FEF engagements: Economic liberalization is where civil society has had the most impact. FEF has been leading the charge to economic liberalization: rice import liberalization, PSA (amended Public Service Act) law allowing foreign participation in more economic activities, free patent law allowing faster grant of titles to patent holders and now allowing consolidation by lifting the five-hectare ownership ceiling and facilitating farm consolidation in the food production sectors. As in Deng’s China, market liberalization is very inclusive in the sense of poverty reduction although it may raise income inequality. The advantage of FEF over other business clubs (MAP or Management Association of the Philippines, MBC or the Makati Business Club, etc.) is that its membership/fellows is not limited to representatives of businesses and firms but also include academics, independent researchers, and public intellectuals.', '', 'Note: (i) the relationship between tech revolution/social media and polarization/inclusion is murky and already heavily covered and discussed in many other local and global fora; added insight may be hard to offer; and, (ii) the response to social cost of illiberal politics and economy is imbedded in the discussion above.', '', 'RB: Economic freedom metrics typically include size of government. As a former Finance undersecretary, I have often wondered whether this is appropriate for a developing country like the Philippines with low tax to GDP ratios and under invests in public goods, especially education and health? In our case we have slipped to the bottom in global rankings on literacy and numeracy, and, not coincidentally, among those who spend least for basic public education. What do you think?', '', 'RF: Barro and Salai-Martin also used size of government as regressor for growth and found that the sign of association is negative. Their interpretation was that it was a proxy for corruption: the more government the more corruption. This interpretation jibes with the weak institution narrative: weak governance tends to throw money and government administration at perceived problems leading to higher government budgets, waste, and corruption. And the allocation of these state resources is skewed towards the squeakiest wheels, fast burn explosions that threaten Armageddon now.', '', 'Unfortunately, neglect of education and human capital infrastructure is a slow burn issue and gets the least attention. And when allocation is increased for education, it supports the same tired formula: more classrooms, more teachers, and more textbooks which result in the same more illiteracy. V. Fabella (2017, “Political-Economic Determinants of Education Reform: Evidence and Interest Group and Student Outcome,” European Journal of Political Economy) has shown that in the battle for reforms in education, access reforms (more classrooms and textbooks) normally trump quality reforms (better trained and motivated teachers) due especially to the opposition of the teachers’ union. In our case, a mortal sin: we can never access exam results of national high school exams to compare quality of high school education outcomes.', '', 'RB. I much enjoyed and learned from your book Capitalism and Inclusion Under Weak Institutions that came out in 2018. It was also the subject of our FEF Paderanga Valera lecture that year. Would you care to talk about it in the remaining time we have?', '', 'RF: On Capitalism and Inclusion: My thesis in the book is that under weak institutions, a greater role of markets is more inclusive defined as poverty incidence. This flies in the face of Piketty (2011) who showed that capitalism or market economics in affluent well-run economies militates against inclusion defined as income inequality. For low-income countries, poverty incidence is the more compelling metric of success. Poverty incidence in the Philippines is highest in the rural areas where the government has effectively vetoed the role of markets for land and finance.', '', 'Romeo L. Bernardo was finance undersecretary from 1990-1996. He is a trustee/director of the Foundation for Economic Freedom, the Management Association of the Philippines, and the FINEX Foundation.

            "['The recent decision of the new head of Twitter, Elon Musk, to sack approximately 50 percent of the workforce is only indicative of the recession that is glooming over the world. The story of Twitter is just one example among many visible ones. Almost all the major firms around the globe have or are planning to lay off employees, including Microsoft, Meta, Tencent, Xiaomi, Unacademy, etc.', '', 'According to a comprehensive study titled ‘Risk of Global Recession in 2023 Rises Amid Simultaneous Rate Hikes’ by the World Bank, all the nation-states are tilting towards a cascade of economic crises in global financial markets and emerging economies, leading to long-term damages. The report blames central banks around the globe for raising interest rates to tackle inflation caused due to the Coronavirus pandemic and Russia’s aggression on Ukraine in the European arena. The report states that even raising the interest rates to an unprecedented high not seen over the past five decades will be insufficient to pull global inflation down to the pre-pandemic levels. It further instils the need to focus on supply disruptions and subside labour-market pressures. The President of the World Bank Group, David Malpass urged policymakers to focus on boosting production instead of cutting consumption and make policies that generate auxiliary investments, improving productivity and capital allocation, which are crucial for growth.', '', 'Economics 101: Recession', '', 'Amidst the pandemic, many states released relief and stimulus packages that heavily leaned on measures to expand liquidity, such as loosening lending restrictions or reducing repo rates (the rate at which commercial banks borrow money from the central bank) as well as reverse repo rates (the rate at which commercial banks lend money to the central bank). China was the first state to act upon these stimulus measures to counteract the disruptions caused by the covid, followed by Japan, the EU, Germany, India and so on. Though the measures helped economies absorb the pandemic’s impact, one major drawback was increased demand due to induced money flow in the market, leading to inflation.', '', 'Inflation, defined as the rate of increase in prices of general goods and commodities in a given period of time, can be caused by multiple factors. A shortfall in aggregate supply, one of the most common factors, can lead to excessive demand pressures in the market. To curb inflation, central banks often tweak or change the fiscal and monetary policies of the nation. Increasing the interest rates is one such measure, as it tightens the economy’s banking system and thus contracts the flow of money, reducing already high demands. However, suppose only the rates are increased without substantial reforms in line with resetting the supply chains, increasing production and overall growth to meet the demand; in that case, a country may move towards a recessionary period. Therefore, alongside rising rates, a nation must diversify its suppliers, invest in technology (without increasing the debt burden), and focus on self-reliance while sustaining employment.', '', 'The International Monetary Fund (IMF) defines recession practically as the fall in a country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), i.e. a decline in the value of all the produced goods and services in a country for two consecutive quarters. Simply, a recession is a period of massive economic slowdown. Pointing at a specific moment when a recession occurs is almost impossible and futile. However, a few indicators, like the downfall of GDP and public spending, increased unemployment, and a decline in sales and a country’s output, generally point towards an upcoming recession. To sum up, there are various ways for a recession to start, from sudden shocks to the economy and excessive debt to uncontrolled inflation (or deflation) and non-performing asset bubbles.', '', 'The Stumbling Economies', '', 'According to IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva, “First, Covid, then Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and climate disasters on all continents have inflicted immeasurable harm on people’s lives.” One-third of the world economies, including the United States, Europe and China, are expected to contract in the subsequent quarters.', '', 'For US economists and forecasters, the recession is no longer about ‘if’ but ‘when’. The decision of the Fed (US Central Bank) to increase rates to cool inflation without inducing higher unemployment and an economic downturn has only shrunk the possibility of a ‘soft landing,’ which occurs when the tightened monetary policies of the Fed reduce inflation without causing a recession. Nouriel Roubini, one of the few economists who rightly predicted the financial crisis of 2008, also claims a prolonged and inevitable recession in 2022 that will last till 2023. Economists expect a growth rate of 0.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2023 as opposed to the fourth quarter of the previous year, and in 2024, they expect the economy to grow at 1.8 percent. The rate of unemployment is expected to rise to 3.7 percent in December this year and to 4.3 percent in June 2023, compared to 3.5 percent in September.', '', 'Like the US, Europe was also under the impression that the economic situation would improve without a recession. Assumptions of subsiding or transitory inflation due to solid businesses, enough public savings and adequate fiscal adjustments turned out wrong for the European economies. The Euro area (5.1 percent), and the UK (6.8 percent), are among the countries with the most expected output loss. Europe has mainly been affected by the Russian war on Ukraine and the resulting oil and gas disruptions leading to an ‘Energy War’ against the former. Similarly, China doesn’t lie far from them, with an expected output loss of 5.7 percent in 2023. Zero Covid Policy, coupled with the mortgage crisis and exodus in the manufacturing sector, has led to the economic slowdown of the Asian giant.', '', 'Impact on the Indian Economy', '', 'India reported a growth of 13.5 percent in the April to June quarter and became the world’s fifth-biggest economy, taking the spot of Great Britain. However, this growth results from the nation’s shutdown amid Delta-driven covid lockdowns during previous quarters and not because of the significant improvements in the economic activities. India needs to focus on skill-based human development projects to unleash its economic potential and effectively utilise its demographic dividend. However, India is not immune to the global slowdown. It is expected to face an output loss of 7.8 percent in 2023.', '', 'Indian CEOs are also expecting a decline in the growth of companies, but the economy is expected to bounce back in the short term, according to KPMG 2022 report. Moreover, 86 percent of CEOs in India expect an impact of up to 10 percent on earnings in the next 12 months. Reducing profit margins, boosting productivity, diversifying supply chains, and implementing a hiring freeze (worst case, layoff policies) are a few steps firms can take to weather such challenges.', '', 'India, thus, needs to tap the potential of start-ups and small enterprises, as opposed to just established firms, by expanding and enhancing the private sector’s access to capital investments and curbing environment-related risks. Reforms in dispute resolution mechanisms are also long overdue, evident through the Ease of Doing Business report, where India ranked 63rd out of 190 countries worldwide. India needs to prove its worth by showing investors that not only can their money achieve decent returns, but it is safe in Indian soil as well.', '', 'The stand on India’s future remains split. The global rating agency S&P claims that India will not face the true and horrifying brunt of the global recession thanks to its decoupled economy with huge domestic demand, healthy balance sheets and enough foreign exchange reserves. On the contrary, according to the Japanese brokerage firm- Nomura, policymakers are misplaced in their optimism about India’s growth trajectory. Its economists assert India’s estimated growth at 7 percent in FY23, which is at par with the RBI’s revised forecasts, but it also predicts a sharp decline to 5.2 percent in FY24. This estimated growth doesn’t align with India’s commitment to becoming a 5 Trillion USD economy.', '', 'Way Forward', '', 'UNCLAD’s Trade and Development Report 2022 projects global economic growth will plunge down to 2.5 percent in 2022, followed by a drop to 2.2 percent in 2023, costing the world a loss of more than 17 trillion USD in productivity. It further warns that the developing nations will be most vulnerable to the slowdown resulting in a cascade of health, debt and climate crises. Regarding the proportion of revenue to public debt, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Angola, Gabon, and Laos are the worst-hit countries, evident through the excessive inflation these states face.', '', 'Similarly, Indian fuel and food commodities prices have increased, but India’s sturdy performance when other countries are struggling can be attributed to its efficient policies. India does not have a perpetual external debt burden to hamper its growth. In addition, the government has focussed on developing the industrial and service sector to promote jobs and increase savings, especially after the Pandemic, to revitalise the Indian economy. Domestically, the government has provided effective social safety nets to ensure healthy livelihood for the population.', '', 'Despite these factors, India must realize and accept the harsh reality of the upcoming turbulent times. India may have a decoupled economy, but the world is one interlinked system. Global slowdowns will lead to a recession in India as well, whose effects are becoming more and more visible with each passing day. Major tech firms in India like Wipro, Tech Mahindra and Infosys have revoked their offer letters to young freshers, while others have started laying off employees amidst the fear of global recession. Irrespective of whether India becomes the “fastest growing economy” in the end, even a modest growth rate of about 5 percent will push millions into poverty in a country like India. It’s only imperative to realise that a depreciating currency and elevated inflation will hit the poorest the hardest, and India must be prepared to deal with this challenge.']\n"

While economies will slow because of tighter monetary policies, the OECD didn’t forecast a recession.Though a survey of US manufacturers showed a fifth month of shrinking activity, another report indicated a healthy increase in business investment. A survey of the euro area businesses indicated that any downturn may not be severe as initially expected.Meantime, the Bank of China eased reserve requirements for banks to help bolster the world’s second-largest economy.Here are some of the charts that appeared on Bloomberg this week on the latest developments in the global economy The world’s central banks must keep raising interest rates to fight pervasive inflation, even as the global economy sinks into a significant slowdown, according to the OECD. The organization raised inflation projections for next year and said that while the global economy will suffer a “significant growth slowdown,” it’s not forecasting a recession.This week saw more major rate hikes across the world, with 75 basis-point hikes in Sweden, New Zealand and South Africa and full percentage-point moves in Pakistan and Nigeria. Turkey went the opposite way, cutting rates by 150 basis points.Business activity contracted for a fifth month in November as demand faltered, while inflationary pressures continued to slowly ease. The S&P Global flash composite purchasing managers’ index slid to the second-lowest level since the immediate aftermath of the pandemic.Orders placed with US factories for business equipment rebounded in October, suggesting capital spending plans are holding up in the face of higher borrowing costs and broader economic uncertainty. Core capital goods shipments jumped the most since the start of the year, suggesting a solid start to fourth-quarter gross domestic product Euro-area businesses see tentative signs that the region’s economic slump may be easing as record inflation cools and expectations for future production improve. A gauge measuring activity in manufacturing and services unexpectedly rose in November, according to S&P Global.Sweden’s home-price decline accelerated in October, as the Nordic country gripped by the most severe housing slump in three decades shows what may lie ahead for many other developed economies.For the second time this year, China’s central bank cut the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, ramping up support for an economy racked by surging Covid cases and a continued property downturn. The People’s Bank of China reduced the reserve requirement ratio for most banks by 25 basis points.Signs are growing in China that local government debt burdens are becoming unsustainable. China’s 31 provincial governments have a stockpile of outstanding bonds that’s close to the Ministry of Finance’s risk threshold of 120% of income. A major cause of the financial squeeze is the property crisis.Australia has spent big to attract swathes of Indian tourists to its shores, signed a free-trade deal with post-Brexit Britain and uncovered new Middle East markets during its 30-month trade rift with China. Still, outside iron ore and other key commodities, there’s been substantial pain for exporters.Chile is set to lead the world into a steep interest rate-cutting cycle next year as inflation slows and its economy goes from boom to bust, according to swap markets. Traders are forecasting more than 5 percentage points in cuts in the next 12 months after a surprise inflation print last month and as the economy teeters on the edge of recession.Shipments of boats, vehicles and computer parts are leading Mexico’s export boom, showing growing US demand for industrial products from its southern neighbor. The export of boats produced in Mexico increased 266% in September compared to a year ago, the fastest-growing item among Mexican exports worth more than $100 million.(With assistance from Maya Averbuch, Sebastian Boyd, Valentina Fuentes, Sybilla Gross, William Horobin, John Liu, Yujing Liu, Swati Pandey, Reade Pickert, Jana Randow, Niclas Rolander, Zoe Schneeweiss and Ben Westcott)']\n"

            "['Cristiano Ronaldo’s second spell at Manchester United has come to an end, in the most abrupt manner. There was no going back for the 37-year-old forward who is currently on international duty with Portugal at the 2022 FIFA World Cup after his tirade against the Red Devils in the Piers Morgan interview.', '', 'Ronaldo bashed the club from every direction, as he also had a go at the manager Erik ten Hag, owners of the Glazers family, and even some former players and interim manager Ralf Rangnick.', '', 'As a result, even before he kicked a ball at the FIFA World Cup Portugal, Cristiano Ronaldo and Manchester United parted ways after a contract termination was agreed upon. The Portuguese captain led his country out of the tunnel in their opening against Ghana as a free agent for the first time in his career.', '', 'With a heap of questions piling up on his future, Ronaldo soo could be the subject of another lucrative offer from the Saudis, who are ready to do everything in order to bring the global star to the middle-east.', '', 'Saudis ready to double their previous offer for Cristiano Ronaldo', '', 'Cristiano Ronaldo already had attempted to leave United in the summer market but was unable to do so. Many of the clubs from around the world had lined up at his doorsteps, but couldn’t take the forward out of Old Trafford.', '', 'Bayern Munich, Chelsea, Sporting Cp, Atletico Madrid, and Napoli were all said to be heavily interested in Ronaldo, but the ones who tabled a mammoth offer were the Saudis. Riyadh-based Al Hilal came calling with a ridiculous bid which was also confirmed by the player himself in the Piers Morgan interview.', '', 'According to multiple reports, the Saudi club offered Ronaldo around £300 million with a contract of two years. That said, the five-time Ballon d’Or winner would have easily pocketed £150 million per year, and could have retired at the end of his contract with an extra £300 million in his already bulging bank account. However, as expected, Ronaldo refused the offer as he still wants to remain in Europe for at least three more years as he revealed in the interview.', '', 'But the Saudis are not going to back down so easily, as they are ready to attempt and lure the now free agent after he wraps up the World Cup campaign with Portugal.', '', 'As per Daily Mirror, Al Hilal is now planning to put a blank cheque in front of Ronaldo and ask him to fill it with the figures which would please him. That’s an audacious offer given they were already ready to pay him £150 million-per-year in the summer.', '', 'The Saudis’ desperate moves to entice Cristiano Ronaldo to the middle-east are said to have some underlying reasons. The Gulf nation is bidding to host the 2030 FIFA World Cup, and wants to use Ronaldo, who recently became the first ever person to gather 500 million Instagram followers, as the face of their bid. The former Real Madrid superstar kicking a ball around in Saudi Arabia itself would be their biggest show of power, after their recent win over Argentina at the 2022 World Cup, and the takeover of Newcastle United which they accomplished last year.', '', 'Even the Saudi Sports Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al-Faisal has endorsed the idea of Ronaldo gracing the country’s football league. On being asked whether he knows in detail Al Hilal’s plans of trying their luck to land the five-time Champions League winner, he told CNN in an interview:', '', '“I don’t know, that’s a straight answer. I read the same thing as you read in the news. I don’t know what his future plans are. Why not? We have a strong league. In each team, we have seven foreign players playing and we are looking to increase that. Our teams play at the top level in Asia. Football is strong in Saudi. So why not?”', '', 'However, it is expected that Ronaldo is set to reject the gigantic offer once again, as he searches for a Champions League club. The all-time top scorer of the competition can still grace it as the teams qualified for the Round of 16 need to submit a fresh list of players for the knockouts after the January transfer market.', '', 'Ronaldo is certainly eyeing the same for now, he strongly stated that he is committed to the Portuguese national team to take as far as he can at the World Cup.']\n"

            "['The BJP government went into 2019 with a lot of energy and momentum. The electoral victory in May that year was decisive and rewarded the Prime Minister with more seats than he had secured in 2014. With the confidence of that mandate, and the idea that the people were with him on change, he began to spend the political capital he had earned. For one year, till June 2020, this continued and then it ran out of steam.', '', 'In this period of 12 months things happened, and much of the aftermath still remain with us. Let us look at how things unfolded.', '', 'On 25 July, the triple talaq bill was passed in the Lok Sabha. The Supreme Court had already invalidated it earlier, but now it was made a criminal offence. This was accompanied by a series of ‘freedom of religion’ laws in BJP states banning marriage between Hindus and Muslims. These were against what was called love jihad.', '', 'A few days after that, on 5 August Article 370 was undone. This was a special moment for the BJP. On 31 August, the final National Register of Citizens was published by Assam, which had begun the process of jailing those who could not prove their ancestors had been in the state before 1971. Another triumphal moment for the BJP came a few weeks after that, on 9 November. The Supreme Court delivered the Ayodhya judgement and handed the full site over for the temple, capping a three decade movement from the BJP. The next month, on 9 December, the Citizenship Amendment Act was passed in the Lok Sabha. Readers will recall that the Home Minister had promised that it was one claw of a two-part pincer. The other being a nationwide NRC.', '', 'The peak arrived a few weeks after that with the visit of then US President Donald Trump in the Narendra Modi stadium in Ahmedabad. This was possibly the point after which the agenda seems to have been exhausted. A nationwide movement against the CAA came with global outrage at what India was doing. The pogrom in Delhi during the presidential visit showed how little control there was even in the capital.', '', 'The next month came the national lockdown which some said was the world’s most severe. It didn’t change the trajectory of COVID infections in India. A few weeks after that was the terrible sequence in Ladakh where we lost 20 soldiers and which altered the national security dynamic of India by default, shifting focus from the west and against Pakistan to the east. We do not know, and even the Foreign Ninister says he is baffled, why China did what it did. On 5 June, one year after the victory came the last attempt at big change: the farm laws ordinance. The protest against them stalled the government’s momentum.', '', 'In Kashmir, having gutted Article 370, the BJP didn’t appear to know what to do next. It still doesn’t appear to know. Kashmir is the only part of South Asia to not have an elected government. It is three years since Article 370 went and four years since its Assembly was dissolved. Violence is not lower than it was in the few years before 2015 and we have seen the minority Pandits protesting about the way they have been treated.', '', 'The laws targeting minorities ran into trouble because they were not passed without application of mind. This month, a legal website ran this headline: “Madhya Pradesh Freedom Of Religion Act: HC finds provision requiring inter-faith couples to declare conversion before Collector ‘Prima Facie Unconstitutional’.” Gujarat High Court also sent a judgment against the law there.', '', 'The farm laws were undone with an apology from the Prime Minister after the largest mass mobilisation this country has seen. The CAA law is now three years old but the government for some reason cannot implement it. The talk of a nationwide NRC has ended.', '', 'Finally, even on the economy, not much was possible on the positive side after this period. The government’s data showed that GDP growth slowed across nine quarters, meaning for two years and three months, beginning January 2018. The arrival of COVID and the hit the economy took masked the damage it had already sustained. The reason Bangladesh overtook India in per capita GDP was not only because India mismanaged the pandemic. Our neighbour had been catching up since 2015 and it was inevitable that unless India did something remarkable to turn around its trajectory it would be left behind, and it was. Unemployment data from the government shows joblessness has been at record highs for four years.', '', 'The BJP’s 2019 manifesto said one of the indicators of its governance was the improvement in India’s position on the World Bank’s Doing Business (previously ease of doing business) rankings. Unfortunately, this ranking was discontinued in 2020 after some countries were found manipulating the process to improve their scores.', '', 'There is not much to show on governance after that one year burst of activity. The second wave finished off any credibility on that front and it was for a reason that even someone as fond of publicity as the Prime Minister did not appear in public for 20 days.', '', 'The listlessness shows in endless political campaigning conducted without much reference to performance, only to charisma. The past is not spoken about though it has not gone away and indeed even demonetisation is being heard by the Supreme Court now though the BJP wants it to be forgotten.']\n"
